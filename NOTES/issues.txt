IF Statement.
i was creating a progam in Ch3 (python for beginners).
Its a guessing game, the computer randomly chooses a number, and the user has to guess it.
The user is limited to 3 guesses

The issue I was running into was, it would not accept the correct guess if it was the last guess, 
but it would accept it if was any of the other guesses.

The solution:
-Don't use "elif". 
-When I changed the "If Statement" to only "Ifs" with no "elif" or "else"

The First Challenge in Chapter 4, pg.155
-Create a program that prints a list of words in random order.
-It should print ALL the words, but not repeat any.

This was quite the issue for me, it took me a while, about a week or two to figure a way to make this happen.
it had to be broken down into sections.
1. creating a list of words
2. indexing that list
3. creating an empty list (to be used for checking)
4. creating a while loop
5. creating a randomly generated number (with in the range of the word list)

From 1 to 3 everything is pretty straight forward, its after that part that things get a bit complex.
The logic is:
>To generate a random number 
>Check that random number to make sure its not repeated
>Compare that random number to the indexed list
>Print out the word that is associated with that number 

My Solution:
Before the loop I had
l = len(word_list)  # to have a number for how long the list is
i = 0  # the incrementer inside the while loop
picked_nums = []   # the empty list




#--- the while loop
while (i < l):

    #----- create a random number generator
    rand_num = random.randint(0,2)
    #-- Check to see if the number is in picked_nums
    if rand_num not in picked_nums:
        # --IF NOT: Add the rand_num to the picked_num list
        picked_nums.append(rand_num)
        print("Randomly Picked Numbers are: ", picked_nums)
        # ---- printing the word associated with choosen number
        print("The word in that index is: ", word_list[rand_num])
        print("\n* * * * *\n")
    else:
        continue
    #-- incrementing the while loop
    i += 1
