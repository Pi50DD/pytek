IF Statement.
i was creating a progam in Ch3 (python for beginners).
Its a guessing game, the computer randomly chooses a number, and the user has to guess it.
The user is limited to 3 guesses

The issue I was running into was, it would not accept the correct guess if it was the last guess, 
but it would accept it if was any of the other guesses.

The solution:
-Don't use "elif". 
-When I changed the "If Statement" to only "Ifs" with no "elif" or "else"
